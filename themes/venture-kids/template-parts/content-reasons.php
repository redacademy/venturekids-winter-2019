<h2>Why We Do It</h2>
<section class='reasons'>
    <div class= 'women'>
        <h4>Women of colour make up 0.2% of venture deals</h4>
        <p>70% of our team are women or POC. Diversity doesn't happen by accident. Our team reflects the students and communities we serve.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class= 'households'>
        <h4>1 in 8 households in Canada is food insecure.</h4>
        <p>We provide students with complimentary lunch because students shouldn't learn on an empty stomach.</p>
    </div>

    <div class= 'school'>
        <h4>1 in 4 parents can't afford school supplies.</h4>
        <p>Not everyone can afford the latest school supplies or a laptop, which is why we provide students with free tools and resources.<p>
