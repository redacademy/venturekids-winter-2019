<h2>How We Do It</h2>

        <section class='process'>
            <div class='productbuilding'>
                <h4>Product Building</h4>
                <p>Building a successful business is about more than just creating a new product. It's about solving a problem. We help entrepreneurs refine a plan so they can create a business that works.<p>
            </div> 
            
            <div class= 'financial'>
                <h4>Financial Literacy</h4>
                <p>Lack of financial literacy is one of the top reasons small business and startups fail. We teach entrepreneurs the financial fundamentals (revenue, cash flow and investment) so they can thrive.<p>
            </div>

            <div class= 'webdev'>
                <h4>Web Development 101</h4>
                <p>Coding is one of today's most in-demand skills. We help students learn introductory HTML, CSS and JavaScript to help them understand how to build and maintain a website.<p>
            </div>

            <div class='growth' >
                <h4>Growth Hacking</h4>
                <p>Growth hacking is more than just a buzzword. The ability to scale and grow can make or break a startup. We help entrepreneurs implement growth strategies, create marketing strategies and foster innovation.</p>
